# knife-hit-replica
> A work by Vo Phu Thanh, Oct 2018

- My personal take on replicating the recent hit from Ketchapp studio. 
- The 5-levels-prototype was finished within a week, and can perform mostly the basic game, except for the knife hitting effects, sfx, and the rotation of the 5th level (boss level) as well as various animations. 
- The "board" model and "knife" (dart, to be exact) model were downloaded freely from Unity Online library. Other materials such as images, backgrounds and buttons, etc were created by me. 
- The prototype is expected to be updated in the future, so wait for the news! Thank you.
